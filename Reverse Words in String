Problem 3: Reverse Words in a String
Reverse the ordering of words in a sentence.

Example:

Input: "The weather is amazing today!"
Output: "today! amazing is weather The"

Approach:
Traverse the string from end
if you find white space then this is the end of the word

def reverse_string(s):
    output = ""
    #clean the input incase it has multiple spaces
    s = " ".join(s.split())
    end = len(s)
    if not end:
        return ""
    for i in range(len(s)-1,-1,-1):
        if s[i] == " ":
            output += s[i+1:end] + " "
            end = i
    return output+s.split()[0]

print((reverse_string("the   sky  is   blue")))
