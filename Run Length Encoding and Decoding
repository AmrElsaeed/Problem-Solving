Problem #2: Run Length Encoding
Given an input string, write a function that returns the run-length encoded string for the input string.*

Example:

Input: "wwwwaaadexxxxxx"
Output: "w4a3d1e1x6"
Challenge: How would you decode the encoded string into the original string?

Approach:
traverse the string and compare each two elements next to each other
incrment counter

def encoding(s):
    length = len(s)
    counter = 0
    result = ""
    for i in range(1, length):
        #counting the number of occurances
        if s[i-1] == s[i]:
            counter += 1
        else:
            #increasing the counter one last time to accomdate the last repetition
            counter +=1
            #concat the output
            result += s[i-1] + str(counter)
            #resetting the counter
            counter = 0

    #for the last char since if it's equal it won't be written in the for loop
    counter += 1
    result += s[-1] + str(counter)

    return result


def decode(s):
    length = len(s)
    result = ""

    for i in range(1, length,2):
        n = int(s[i])
        print(s[i-1] *n, end="")



input = "wwwwaaadexxxxxx"
output=encoding(input)
print(output)
decode(output)
