Problem 2 (Challenge) - Longest Consecutive Subsequence
Original Problem on GeeksforGeeks: Longest Consecutive Subsequence


Given an unsorted array of integers, we want to find the length of the longest subsequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers. The consecutive numbers can be in any order.

Examples:

Input: [1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20 , 2]
Output: 4
[1, 3, 4, 2] is the longest subsequence of consecutive elements.


pseudo code:
sort the array
traverse through the sorted array and check if each two values are conesective
'''

def subsequence(nums):
    nums = sorted(nums)
    counter = 0
    maxi = 0
    for i in range(1,len(nums)):
        if nums[i-1] + 1 == nums[i]:
            counter += 1
            maxi = max(maxi,counter)
        else:
            counter = 0
    return maxi+1
print(subsequence([1, 2,3,4]))
print(subsequence([5,6,8,1,2,9,7]))
